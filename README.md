# Final-Exam-Scheduler

The project is coded in Java. The logic behind the scheduler is based on weekly meeting time of each course. Student can't register to courses that have the same or colliding meeting time. Therefore, this can be used to reduce the number of different schedules. Specifically in the case of course2500.txt, the original number of listed schedules was over 400, reduced down to only 27 to be assigned final exam period. 

However, limitations are present in the execution of this logic, and a different system for storing objects would significantly improve organization.
